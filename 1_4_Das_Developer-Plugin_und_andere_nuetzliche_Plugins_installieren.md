# Das Developer-Plugin und andere n√ºtzliche Plugins installieren

When you develop themes or plugins it can be useful to have WordPress tell you what's going on and when something is not working right. To make this possible, there are a handful of plugins that you can choose to install on your site for debugging purposes. All of these plugins have been bundled into one super plugin called Developer. Now Developer is quite an unusual plugin so let me show you how it works. First, go to the back end of your site, plugins and add new, and search for Developer. The first option here should be the correct one, it's one called Developer created by Automattic.

Install and activate it. And when you do so, you'll get this modal pop-up that asks you: before we begin, what type of website are you developing? Here you can choose from plugin for a self hosted WordPress installation, theme for a self-hosted WordPress installation, and theme for a WordPress.com VIP site. In my case I want to choose theme for a self-hosted WordPress installation and you want to do the same. Then you click save changes. And the plugin will now suggest a long list of optional plugins you can install to help with development.

This is the whole purpose of the Developer plugin. Developer is a helper plugin that assists you in installing useful plugins so you don't have to source them out yourself one at a time. All of these are optional, and you can choose to install one of them, some of them, or none of them, and you can always install or uninstall each one individually later. I won't go into great detail about each of these different developer plugins in this course 'cause they're all worth installing and experimenting with so you know what they are, what they do, and when you'll need them. For this course, there are a couple I'm going to install, starting at the top, the debug bar adds debugging to the WordPress tool bar at the very top.

Scrolling down I'll install the monster widget, which makes it easy to add a lot of widgets to a sidebar very quickly. I'll install regenerate thumbnails, which allows me to regenerate any featured images, once I have changed the default settings. And scrolling down to the bottom I'll install theme check. Theme check runs a basic test on my theme to make sure it meets the basic WordPress standards. Once I've made my selections, I click get developing, I'm taken back to the plugins page, and here I can see all the different plugins that were installed by the plugin: debug bar, monster widget, regenerate thumbnails, and theme check.

If you want to deactivate or delete any of these plugins, you will do it from the plugin development page right here. If you want to add additional plugins that were listed in the Developer plugin itself, you can now go to tools and developer and from here you choose the project type, and you can see a full list of all the available plugins for your project. Now if we scroll to the bottom of this page, there is some additional information that's important to keep in mind. At the top it says, we recommend you set the following constants to true in your wp-config file, WP_debug, and save queries, all these are important tools that it may be a good idea to turn on in your configuration so that WordPress is able to give you information about what's going on.

WP_debug enables debug mode which will identify and try to resolve issues in your code. And save queries logs the database queries in an array so you can review them. That means if something weird is happening and you need to see what the communication is between WordPress and the database, that is all saved and you can review it later. For this course, we only need WP_debug, so we're going to set that right now. You can use any text editor for this. I'm choosing to use Atom, this is the only time you'll see me use Atom in this course by the way.

Here I've opened WP-config in my local install of WordPress, so this is a current installation you're seeing in my browser. This file contains all the information about how WordPress talks to the database, if you're using a database name and username and password and all that stuff. And what I'm looking for is at the very bottom of the file down here, define WP_debug, this is set to false by default, because you don't want WordPress to cough up air messages all the time on the front end. But in our case because we're doing development, we'll set it to true.

Save, go back to WordPress and reload the developer page, and you'll see the WP debug constant is now set. Now, before we go to the front end and look at what we can do with these debugging tools I want to install one more plugin. I'll go back to plugins and add new, and this time I want to install a plugin called show current template. Show current template does exactly what it sounds like, it tells you which template files are in use for any view within WordPress. Now we're going to cover this in much more detail later, but it's a good idea to install it now so you'll get used to it.

So for example, I am now on the front page of my site, this is the index page that shows the current blog, up in my toolbar, show current template gives me a list of all the files that are combining to show me what I'm currently seeing. So here when I hover over the option you see the template relative path is humescores/index.php so that's the main template. I'm using the humescores theme and it is not a child theme, and these are all the files that combine to produce the content I'm currently seeing.

So I'm not just using index.php I'm also using footer.php and functions and header and custom header and customizer and extras and jetpack and so on and so on. As you go through the different pages and polls in your site it's a good idea to take a look up here to figure out which files are currently in play and which files are producing the view you're looking at. That makes it much easier as you move forward in your development and you want to make a change to maybe one view but not the other one, 'cause here you can see exactly what is going on.

We've also added a new debug feature to the tool bar, you can see it up here. If you click on debug, you get a debug log of what is currently happening on your site. Now right now everything is fine, so we're not really getting any useful information. But if you add a code error to your code, either in PHP or JavaScript, this debug button in the tool bar will turn red and when you go in, you can actually see a breakdown of the debug log. And it'll tell you exactly what went wrong. As we get further into the course, you'll see me using this tool anytime there's an error.

Having these developer plugins installed can help you quickly identify and fix problems in your theme as you're developing it. My advice is to start with the key ones I pointed out during the install process, and then later on add some more in and figure out exactly how they work and how you can use them in your process.
